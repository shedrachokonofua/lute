# Mandolin

Mandolin is a tiny web-app for getting album recommendations on rateyourmusic lists.

## How it works:

1. User enters a list URL
2. Mandolin starts a list lookup on lute
3. When lute completes the lookup, Mandolin creates a Lute profile and populates it with the list data
4. Mandolin serves a recommendation page based on the list profile
